# SDD-Project
SDD Major Project - Projectile Motion

This project is for the Software Design and Development HSC in NSW, Australia.

Proposal: Projectile Motion Visualizer

This program will take several variables relating to projectile motion eg. Initial velocity, maximum height the projectile reaches, the range of the projectile, etc. and will determine the rest of the variables and show the path of the projectile on a graph. Developing the graph will involve measuring what height the projectile is at a point of the projectileâ€™s motion and placing a dot on the graph. The graph could have multiple dots to create a curve.
